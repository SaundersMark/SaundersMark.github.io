<p>This page supports my MIND6004 feasibility study</a>.</p>

<h2>Audio illustration</h2>

<!-- Changed this part to a list -->
<p>This page contains a <a href="Audio for report2\combined_output.html"></a>link to a page that illustrates 30 samples from the BirdSoundsDenoising dataset with a varying range of dice scores, shown in increasing order</p>
<ul>
    <li>The name of the audio file and the bird species being shown</li>
    <li>An image of the original audio file converted into a spectrogram</li>
    <li>An image of the expert-created mask that is treated as the ground-truth</li>
    <li>An image of the mask created by the DeepLabV3 segmentation model</li>
    <li>The dice score of the two masks (multiplied by 100), with 0.0 meaning no similarity, 100 meaning perfect similarity</li>
    <li>A button to play the original audio file plus the denoised audio files created with each mask</li>
    <li>A link to the recording on the xeno-canto website</li>
    <li>Details on the call quality (per xeno-canto)</li>
    <li>Details of whether BirdNET can detect a bird species in the original audio file or the denoised audio files created with the expert mask. The percentage shown is BirdNET's confidence level.</li>
    <li>Comments prepared by Mark on the original audio and the two denoised audio files.</li>
</ul>
