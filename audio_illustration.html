<h1>MIND6004 - Feasibility Study</h1>
<p>This page supports my MIND6004 feasibility study.</p>

<h2>Audio illustration</h2>

<p>This page contains a link to a page that illustrates 30 samples from the BirdSoundsDenoising dataset with a varying range of dice scores</p>
<p>On this page you will see an illustration like the one below showing:
    - The name of the audio file and the bird species being shown 
    - An image of original audio file converted into a spectrogram
    - An image of the expert-created mask that is treated as the ground-truth
    - An image of the mask created by the DeepLabV3 segmentation model
    - The dice score of the two masks (multiplied by 100) - 0 means no similarity, 100 means perfect similarity
    - A link to play the original audio file plus the denoised audio files created with each mask
    - A link to the recording on the xeno-canto website
    - Details on the call quality (per xeno-canto)
    - Details of whether BirdNET can detect a bird species in the original audio file or the denoised audio files created with the expert mask.  The percentage shown is its confidence level.
    - Comments prepared by Mark Saunders on the original audio and the two denoised audio files.
