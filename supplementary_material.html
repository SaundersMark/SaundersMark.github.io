<h1>MIND6004 - Feasibility Study</h1>
<p>This page supports my MIND6004 feasibility study.</p>

<h2>Supplementary metadata</h2>

<p>The metadata collated for the feasibility study can be split into the following categories:

    1. Provided by the BirdSoundsDenoising dataset:

        ID
        Dataset (train, validate and test)
    
    2. Determined by inspecting the audio files and masks in the BirdSoundsDenoising dataset:

        Recording length
        Sample rate
        Mask edges (high and low frequencies, start and end times)
        Mask pixel count (original and resized)

    3. Metadata extracted from xeno-canto

        Bird species and common names
        Location of recordings (country, location, latitude and longitude)
        Type of call (e.g. song)
        Recording quality (e.g. A, B, C)
        Date of recording
        Remarks on the recording
        Equipment used
        Whether the audio has been processed
        Whether the recording has been deleted

    4. BirdNET data

        The birds species and probabilities recognised in the original audio and denoised audio
    
    5. Some narrative comments

    6. Dice score for an illustrative model run using 1,000 samples

    The file is in csv format and is approximately 3MB in size. It can be downloaded from the link below.</p>
